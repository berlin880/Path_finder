# Path_finder

# Introduction:

This repository contains a Python program for visualizing pathfinding algorithms using Pygame and Tkinter libraries. Pathfinding algorithms are used to find the shortest path between two points on a grid while avoiding obstacles.
Features:

    Visualizes the A* pathfinding algorithm.
    Allows users to set custom start and end points on the grid.
    Users can create obstacles on the grid to test pathfinding algorithms.
    Option to show step-by-step pathfinding visualization.

# Installation:

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

    git clone <repository-url>

    Install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
        Pygame
        Tkinter

# Usage:

    Run the pathfinding_visualizer.py file:

    bash

    python pathfinding_visualizer.py

    A window will open displaying a grid. Follow the instructions provided:
        Input the starting point (x,y) and the ending point (x,y) in the provided fields.
        Optionally, select the "Show Steps" checkbox to visualize each step of the algorithm.
        Click the "Submit" button to start the visualization.

    Create obstacles on the grid by clicking on any grid cell. Obstacles are represented by white cells.

    Press the space bar to start the pathfinding visualization.

    Once the algorithm finds the shortest path, a message box will display the shortest distance. You can choose to rerun the program or exit.

    Close the Pygame window to exit the program.
